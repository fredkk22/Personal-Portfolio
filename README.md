## Description

The Module 2 challenge was to create a portfolio site that consisted of a header with my name and a navigation bar, a subtitle section, an "About Me" section, a "Work" section, and a "Contact Me" section - in that order from top to bottom.

The reason for creating a portfolio was to develop a website where I could showcase my previous work and learned skills to possible future employers after the UPenn LPS bootcamp is over. In order to successfully find employment, I must have several projects deployed and accessible through this portfolio website. The more projects we create, the more content my portfolio will have, the better chance at employment I have.

I was able to learn more about and become more comfortable with media queries, flexbox, CSS grids, and defining/applying CSS variables throughout this challenge.
